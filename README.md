# Scalaplat Skeleton

Example project for a single service leveraging scalaplat libraries and conventions.

There is a simple Akka Http Server with two routes defined for the API.

There are a couple of tests which exercise the API routes.

Produce a fat jar with `sbt assembly` - it will be about 30MB in size.

Run the fat jar with `java -jar scalaplat-skeleton_2.13_0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
